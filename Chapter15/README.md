# Chapter 15 - Implementing a Data Mesh Strategy

In this chapter we explored the concept of a data mesh approach to organizing data responsibilities within an organization. We started off by
examining the four core principals of a data mesh:

- Domain-orientated, decentralized data ownership
- Data as a product
- Self-service data infrastructure as a platform
- Federated computational governance

We then looked at how a data mesh approach can solve a number of challenges that exist with traditional data lake approaches. This included
understanding how a centralized data team can be a bottleneck, how traditionally product teams did not consider data analytics to be there
"problem", and how there was a lack of organization wide visibility into which datasets were available. 

We then reviewed the organizational and technical challenges of building a data mesh. This included a discussion of the difficulties of
changing the way that an organization traditionally appraoched data analytics, and how a data mesh approach changed the way that a
centralized data and analytics team worked. We then looked at the changes needed for line of business teams, and finally at how there
were a number of technical challenges to building a data mesh. 

After that we examined the AWS services that can help to build a data mesh, including a look at a recently launched AWS service, Amazon DataZone.
We also reviewed a sample architecture for building a data mesh using borg AWS services, and 3rd party services. 

In the hands-on section we looked at practical steps for implementing a data mesh approach on AWS.
