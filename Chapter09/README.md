# Chapter 9 - A deeper-dive into Data Marts and Amazon Redshift

In this chapter, we learned how a cloud data warehouse can be used to
optimize performance for hot data. We reviewed some common "anti-patterns"
for data warehouse usage before diving deep into Redshift architecture to learn more
about how Redshift optimizes data storage across nodes.

We then reviewed some of the important design decisions that need to be made when
creating a Redshift cluster in order to optimize performance while balancing costs, and also
reviewed ssome of the advanced Redshift features. 

## Hands-on Activity
In the hands-on section of this chapter we created a new Redshift Serverless cluster,
configured Redshift Spectrum to query data from Amazon S3, and then loaded a
subset of data from S3 into Redshift.
